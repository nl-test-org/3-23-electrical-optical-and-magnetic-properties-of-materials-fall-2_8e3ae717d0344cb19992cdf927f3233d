For further study, student received two sets of exercises on quantum mechanics, the 2007 midterm for 3.23, and all the corresponding solutions.

QM exercises 1 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/study-materials/qm1)), solutions ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/study-materials/qm1_sol))

QM exercises 2 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/study-materials/qm2)), solutions ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/study-materials/qm2_sol))

Midterm ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/study-materials/midterm)), solutions ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/study-materials/midterm_sol))
